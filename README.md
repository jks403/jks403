- 👋 Hi, I’m Joshua Stewart
- 👀 I’m a full stack applications developer using JavaScript, Node.Js, EJS, JSON, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I am using DigitalOcean to host the server. I use it to manage my dns servers to resolve my domain, shuadev.org to an ip address. I host this on top of an Nginx server where I host subdomains, blog.shuadev.org, and configure the virtual servers to host my Node.js server and use Nginx as a proxy. I have configured my uncomplicated firewall to only allow port 443 for https, 80, and port 22 for http.
- I have also integrated continuous integration using a cronjob to pull from Github every two minutes and continuous deployment so whenever I make a change, the entire code is updated immediately.  
- 🌱 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applications to optimize organizations business models enabling them to prosper and thrive in the present economy and in the future.
