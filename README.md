- 👋 Hi, I’m Joshua Stewart
- 👀 I’m a computer scientist developing full stack applications with JavaScript, Node.Js, Mongoose, EJS, JSON, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I start by interviewing the business owner/client and developing/documenting business rules and designing the entity relationship diagrams. This is accompanied by documenting the data, the unknowns, the conditions, any assumptions we make, and the variables to solve for. A Flowchart/algorithm is drafted simultaneously to map out the code to be written. 
- 🌱 I’m currently developing applications using Javascript,Mongodb,JSON, Jquery, Node.Js, git & github for version control, JSON for APIs, CSS, Bootstrap frameworks, building my own servers using NodeMon, Heroku servers, etc among many other languages and technologies. I also have applications and host my own server @ joshuakane.net and https://shielded-bayou-55638.herokuapp.com which is a newsletter sign up I've designed that connects to Mailchimp servers using an API key.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applications to optimize organizations business models enabling them to prosper and thrive in the present economy and in the future.
