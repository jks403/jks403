- 👋 Hi, I’m Joshua Stewart
- 👀 I’m a computer scientist interested in Full stack development starting with the business rules of the client and designing the entity relationship diagrams all the way to the application layer
- 🌱 I’m currently developing applications using Javascript, SQL, Jquery, Node.Js, git & github for version control, JSON for APIs, CSS, Bootstrap frameworks, building my own servers using NodeMon, Heroku servers, etc among many other languages and technologies. I also have applications and host my own server @ joshuakane.net and https://shielded-bayou-55638.herokuapp.com which is a newsletter sign up I've designed that connects to Mailchimp servers using an API key.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applications that optimize orgaization's posture enabling them to prosper and thrive for many years to come
