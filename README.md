- 👋 Hi, I’m Joshua Stewart
- 👀 I’m a full stack applications developer using JavaScript, Node.Js, EJS, JSON, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I start by interviewing the business owner/client and developing/documenting business rules and designing the entity relationship diagrams. This is accompanied by gathering the data, the unknowns, the conditions, any assumptions we make, and the variables to solve for. A Flowchart/algorithm is drafted to map out the code to be written. 
- 🌱 I’m currently developing applications using Javascript,Mongodb,JSON, Jquery, Node.Js, git & github for version control, JSON for APIs, CSS, Bootstrap frameworks, building my own servers using NodeMon, Heroku servers, etc among many other languages and technologies. I also have applications and host my own server @ https://joshuakane.net/emp/www/joshua.php which is a full stack application using Sql Server for the backend and PHP to link up the front-end to the database.The use case let's the user enter in a new PPNorCal employee, employee department number, and submit the data to the PHPMyAdmin server on the backend. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applications to optimize organizations business models enabling them to prosper and thrive in the present economy and in the future.
